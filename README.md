Project Name: Pizza Clicker
Team Name: Pizzahh
Team Members: Quentin

I'm trying to build my own version of the game cookie clicker, but instead using pizzas. 
I want to build it because I like the idea of having a game you can run in the background and mess with throughout the day.
It should be used as a stress free game to fiddle with through the day.
