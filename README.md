Project Name: Pizza Clicker
Team Name: Pizzahh

To run the program clone the repository and launch the application.

I'm trying to build my own version of the game cookie clicker, but instead using pizzas. 
I want to build it because I like the idea of having a game you can run in the background and mess with throughout the day.
It should be used as a stress free game to fiddle with through the day.

UML Brief Summary
This app uses the 
PizzaClickerApp class to handle the UI and user interactions
PizzaGame class to handle game logic
musicStuff to handle the looping music
Upgrade abstract class to handle the upgrades
